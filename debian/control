Description: C library for high-throughput sequencing data formats
 HTSlib is a unified C library for accessing common file formats, such as SAM
 (Sequence Alignment/Map) and VCF (Variant Call Format), used for nucleic acid
 sequence data obtained by high-throughput sequencing.
 .
 HTSlib implements a generalized BAM (binary SAM) index.  The HTSlib file
 reader first looks for the new index and then for the old if the new index is
 absent.
 .
 HTSlib is still experimental.  It has not been tested on large-scale real
 data. Some useful APIs are missing.
